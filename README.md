# laravel_basic_crud_generator
very simple app that takes db credentials and creates basic routes, resourceful controllers, and views for laravel

create db, and import included sql file
This code is meant for local dev enviroment, do not put Live DB credentials in this app

go to index add project, add database connection and it wil create
Routes
Views
Controllers
& Models

If you want to change the template or add variables
check the stubs folder and the CrudTemplateVariable Class
It currently has alot of extra code, but i had alot of false starts geting it work, will clean up more as I progress
